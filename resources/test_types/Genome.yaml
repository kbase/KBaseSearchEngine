# This specification describes how a Workspace Genome object is transformed into a document that is
# indexed by the KBaseSeachEngine.

# The name of the type in the search system.
global-object-type: Genome
# The data source of the objects, in this case the Workspace.
storage-type: WS
# The name of the type in the data source.
storage-object-type: KBaseGenomes.Genome

# IMPORTANT NOTE: Once a type version is established in the search system, the type version
# CANNOT be changed or given a new version number (i.e. by changing the ordering of the versions)
# without dropping the ElasticSearch indexes for the type.

# This list contains different versions of the parsing rules used to parse the specified
# storage-object-type. The list is ordered by version number. Each parsing rule version results
# in a corresponding search type version. The mapping between the source storage-object-type
# version and the target search type version is specified by the type mappings.
# If no type mapping is specified for this type, the latest version is used.
