Search Service MKII release notes
=================================

0.2.2-dev1
-----
* Changed search_objects and search_types to optionally require auth. Unauthorized calls will only
see results from public data. Will throw exception if with_public and with_private are both false.

0.2.1
-----
****  Made the following changes that affect the interface.

* In KBaseSearchEngine.spec, renamed the usage of workspace_info to access_group_info,
  in the output from searchobjects and getobjects.
  * Renamed the usage of workspace_info with access_group_info in variable, method and
    class in the module.

* In KBaseSearchEngine.spec, moved the flags addNarrativeInfo and addAccessGroupInfo
  from match filter parameter to the postprocessing parameter provided to the search API.

0.1.3
-----

* Added a Workspace Info decorator, which adds a map of workspaces info (key: workspace id and
  value: the Tuple from get_workspace_info()), and a map of objects info (key: object_ref
  value: the Tuple from get_object_info3) to the search results.

* The narrative info decorator and workspace info decorator can be enabled by setting the flags,
  addNarrativeInfo, and addWorkspaceInfo respectively in the match filter parameter provided to the
  search API.

0.1.2
-----

* Added a Narrative Info decorator, which adds a map of narrative info (containing narrative id,
  narrative name, date created, workspace username, workspace display name), to the search results.
  The narrative info and auth info (containing workspace user display name) are cached.

0.1.1
-----

1. Fixed a bug where an empty list of subobjects in a parent object would cause a general (e.g.
  no `key.*` fields) parent record to be stored in the subobject index in ElasticSearch. 
2. Adds more information to the error thrown when encountering an unexpected type in a recursive
  index
3. Removed `data_includes` from the API, as it was unimplemented.
4. Changed `lookupInKeys` to lookup\_in_keys to be consistent with other fields.
5. Removed `skip_info` from the API, as it is unused and provides little to no benefit in
  transport costs.
6. Removed `object_props` from the API and moved its contents into top level fields in the
  `ObjectData` structure.
7. Added CLI for re-running failed events.
8. All workspace handler events are now updated to reflect the latest state of objects before
   the objects are indexed. 

0.1.0
-----

1. Initial release
